Description: Shared library for the Onion Name System
 OnioNS is a privacy-enhanced, metadata-free, and highly-usable DNS for Tor
 onion services. Administrators can use the Onion Name System to anonymously
 register a meaningful and globally-unique domain name for their site. Users
 can then load the site just by typing "example.tor" into the Tor Browser.
 OnioNS is backwards-compatible with traditional .onion addresses, does not
 require any modifications to the Tor binary or network, and there are no
 central authorities in charge of the domain names. This project was
 specifically engineered to solve the usability problem with onion services.
 .
 This package provides a shared library for the other OnioNS packages.
