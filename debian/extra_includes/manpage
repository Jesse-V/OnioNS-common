.SH NAME
The Onion Name System (OnioNS) \- Tor-powered Distributed DNS for Tor Hidden Services

.SH SYNOPSIS
    OnioNS\fR [\fB--help\fR|\fB--license\fR|\fB--version\fR]
    OnioNS\fR [\fB--client\fR|\fB--server\fR|\fB--hs --hskey\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Tor a third-generation onion router that acts as anonymizing communication service. Users choose a path through a set of three Tor nodes and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals the downstream node.

Tor also supports hidden services, anonymous servers that intentionally hide their IP address through Tor circuits. Traditionally, hidden services have major usability issues because their addresses are algorithmically generated. OnioNS allows clients to access hidden services by a meaningful, globally-unique domain name chosen by the hidden service operator.

.SH OPTIONS

OnioNS is primarily a command-line utility.

In the typical Unix fashion, flags with values use the following syntax:
    --<option>=<value>
  while boolean on/off flags use:
    --<option> or -<option>

\fB -c \fR or \fB --client \fR
        Enables client mode, which is useful for resolving domain names.

\fB -h \fR or \fB --help \fR
        Prints list of flags and usage examples and then quits.

\fB -d \fR or \fB --hs \fR
        Enables hidden service mode, useful for registering claims on domain names and managing DNS information. You must specify --hskey as well.

\fB -k \fR or \fB --hskey \fR
        The path to the hidden service private RSA key. Used with --hs.

\fB -l \fR or \fB --license \fR
        Prints license information and then quit.

\fB -s \fR or \fB --server \fR
        Enables name server mode, which resolves queries for remote clients.
